# Travel App Project
This is the last project for the Udacity frontend web development nanodegree.
It is a web app that comunicates with a nodejs backend server (uses express).
The backend has 2 endpoints:
1 - GET data -- /data
2 - POST data -- /add

The frontend has also validation rules for input fields, when all fields are validated a call to OpenWeatherAPI is made in order to retrieve temperature.
A entry is stored in the backend, and then rendered in the frontend UI.
